## Forks

- https://github.com/okke-formsma/dactyl-manuform-tight/
- https://github.com/lebastaq/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard

## Features

- As low stack height as possible
- Choc switch support, tight spacing
- Optional encoder and Cirque trackpad options

## Generate OpenSCAD and STL models

- Run `lein repl`
- In the repl run `(load-file "src/sphynx.clj")`
- This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
- Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
- Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
- When done, use OpenSCAD to export STL files

## Tips

- When trying things out, 10 seconds of rendering time in OpenSCAD is really annoying. Load one of the test outputs with commented out parts that you don't use.
- If you're not sure what things are generted by a piece of code, color them in using something like
  `(color [0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5] (the code)`
